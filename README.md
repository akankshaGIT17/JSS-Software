POC-1

AIM: To do asynchronous calls and get response from various APIs.

Problem Definition: Generate 5 APIs using this link: https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/
You can use some other source also to get APIs. All the APIs should have POST request. If you are not able to get 5 APIs then you can generate less than 5 also.
After getting the APIs, create a page with a button on it. When the button is clicked, all the 5 APIs should be called asynchronously. Fetch the response from API in json and keep deiplaying the response on the page in a table on first come first serve basis.
